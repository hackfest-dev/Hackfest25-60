## üéôÔ∏è Overview

Podcast Lab is an integral component of the Searchify.Ai ecosystem that extends the research experience beyond textual content. It processes academic papers, research documents, and reports, converting them into high-quality audio podcasts that researchers, students, and professionals can listen to anywhere.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **PDF Processing**: Extract and process text content from PDF research papers
- **Content Structuring**: Intelligently organize document content for optimal listening experience
- **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Generate natural-sounding audio using advanced TTS technology
- **Audio Post-Processing**: Enhance audio quality for clear podcast consumption
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with papers generated by Searchify.Ai or external documents

## üöÄ How It Works

The PDF-to-Podcast pipeline follows these main steps:

1. **Document Ingestion**: Upload PDF documents or use papers generated by Searchify.Ai
2. **Text Extraction & Cleaning**: Parse PDF content and clean up formatting artifacts
3. **Content Restructuring**: Organize text for better listening flow and comprehension
4. **Narration Generation**: Convert text to natural-sounding speech
5. **Audio Enhancement**: Apply audio processing for professional podcast quality
6. **Export & Delivery**: Save as MP3/other audio formats for consumption on any device

## üíª Technical Implementation

The conversion pipeline is implemented in a Jupyter notebook (`pdf_podcast.ipynb`) for easy experimentation and adaptation. The notebook leverages:

- **PyPDF2/PDFMiner**: For extracting text from PDF documents
- **NLTK/spaCy**: For natural language processing and text restructuring
- **Text-to-Speech APIs**: For high-quality voice synthesis (compatible with various providers)
- **Audio Processing Libraries**: For enhancing the listening experience

## üèÅ Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.7+
   - Jupyter Notebook environment
   - Required Python packages (see installation section)

2. **Installation**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Basic Usage**:
   - Open `pdf_podcast.ipynb` in Jupyter
   - Follow the step-by-step instructions within the notebook
   - Upload your PDF or point to an existing file
   - Run the cells to generate your podcast

## üîó Integration with Searchify.Ai

Podcast Lab can be used:
- As a standalone tool for converting any PDF to audio
- Integrated with the Searchify.Ai research pipeline to automatically convert generated research reports
